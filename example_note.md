This is an example note with various cards to show what you can do.

NeuraCache can consume independent files or traverse a directory in search of cards. This works great with second brain tools like Obsidian.
Let's start with some basic micro cards:

Who was the first president of the USA? : George Washington ⚡️

You can also create decks with micro cards by adding various tags:

How many people are bitten by snakes each year? : 5.3M ⚡️ #nature #travel
How many people die each year from snake bites? : ~130k ⚡️ #nature #travel

Instead of ⚡️ you can also use 🧠 or flashcard tag.
For one line spaced repetition, use spaced tag:

"We are what we repeatedly do" #spaced

and similarly, you can group these cards into decks with tags

"Excellence is not an act but a habit" #spaced #quotes

Now let's create some more complex cards. 
Multi-line, Latex, and images are fine 👍

We end the card with a horizontal line which can defined with :
\-\-\-, \- \- \-, \*\*\*, \* \* \*

Let's try:
Radii of stable orbits in the Bohr model #flashcard #physics

$$a_0  = \frac{{ \hbar ^2}}{{m_e ke^2}}$$
(you can also inline) $\Delta E = h\nu$ and $c = \lambda \nu$

- - -

And the same thing with complex spaced repetition blocks: 

#spaced #quotes
"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit."

You can also use local images. Just make sure that within the NeuraCache app, you either import a folder (where the .md and image is located) or, in case of a single file import -> tap and hold on the .md file and then tap the associated image (see here: https://youtu.be/Q_GD884BpW8?t=219)
